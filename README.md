# PneuomoScan.ai

## Overview
PneuomoScan.ai is a Streamlit application designed for detecting pneumonia from X-ray images. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically variants like AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet18, this application aims to accurately classify X-ray images as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative. The dataset utilized for training and testing purposes is sourced from Kaggle.

## Dataset Details
The dataset used for training and testing the PneuomoScan.ai application is sourced from Kaggle. It comprises a collection of X-ray images labeled with pneumonia-positive and pneumonia-negative cases.

## Models Used
During the development phase, several CNN variants were experimented with. Among them, ResNet18 emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of 0.89 on the test dataset. This indicates its robustness and effectiveness in accurately identifying pneumonia from X-ray images.
